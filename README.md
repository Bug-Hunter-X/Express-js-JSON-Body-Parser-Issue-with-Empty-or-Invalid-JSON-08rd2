# Express.js JSON Body Parser Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `express.json()` middleware in Express.js applications.  The problem arises when handling requests with empty or invalid JSON request bodies.  The server may not report an error, instead logging an empty object, making debugging challenging.  This example showcases the problem and provides a solution.

## Problem
The `express.json()` middleware is expected to parse JSON data from the request body. However, if the body is empty or contains invalid JSON, it might not behave as expected. Instead of throwing an error or returning an appropriate error response, it may simply log an empty object, leading to confusion and silent failures.

## Solution
The solution involves adding error handling to gracefully manage cases where the request body is either empty or contains invalid JSON.  This usually involves using `try...catch` blocks to handle parsing errors and sending appropriate responses to the client.
